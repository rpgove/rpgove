### Robert Gove - Data Visualization Engineer :chart_with_upwards_trend:

I am a data visualization engineer at [Two Six Technologies](https://www.twosixtech.com). There I design and develop visual analytic tools, primarily for cyber security analysts.

I enjoy designing and developing innovative data analysis tools. Most recently I've worked in the areas of data summarization, graph visualization, high-dimensional visualization, and machine learning for optimizing visualizations. I've published several [blog posts](https://rpgove.com/blogs/) and [papers](https://rpgove.com/publications/) about [projects](https://rpgove.com/projects/) on these and other topics, and I've released some of those projects open source, which you can find here on GitHub.

Please visit my website at [rpgove.com](https://rpgove.com/) to learn more about me.
